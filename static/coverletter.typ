Dear Hiring Manager,

I am writing to express my interest in the Grand & Incentive Lead position at Higher Ground Consulting. With my analytical background in Computer Science from The University of Texas at Dallas and my experience in project leadership and research, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team's success in grant management and incentive program development.

My academic and professional experiences have equipped me with the skills necessary for this role. As a researcher advised by both Emily Fox at TCS Research and Jin-Ryong Kim in HCI Research, I've developed strong abilities in analyzing complex data, identifying patterns, and communicating findings effectively. These research experiences have honed my attention to detail and analytical thinking—crucial skills for successful grant writing and program development.

My leadership experience as the team lead for Project Kaos, where I managed a team of 15 people using Scrum methodology, demonstrates my ability to coordinate multiple stakeholders, establish clear objectives, and drive projects to completion. This experience taught me valuable lessons in resource allocation, timeline management, and effective communication that would transfer directly to managing grant programs and incentive initiatives.

What particularly draws me to Higher Ground Consulting is your reputation for innovative approaches to solving complex problems. My publication on "PropType: Everyday Props as Typing Surfaces in Augmented Reality," which received an ACM CHI 2025 Honorable Mention, reflects my own innovative thinking and ability to develop novel solutions. I believe this mindset would be valuable in identifying new grant opportunities and designing effective incentive programs for your clients.

Although my background may not follow a traditional path for this role, I believe my combination of technical expertise, research experience, and leadership skills provides a fresh perspective that would be valuable to your team. I am a quick learner with a passion for mastering new domains, and I would approach the Grand & Incentive Lead role with the same dedication that has allowed me to maintain a 3.99 GPA while engaging in multiple research and project initiatives.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my skills and enthusiasm could benefit Higher Ground Consulting. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Iniyan Joseph
