Dear Hiring Committee,

I am writing to express my interest in the Math Adjunct Faculty position at Dallas College. As a Computer Science student at The University of Texas at Dallas with a strong foundation in mathematics and experience as a grader for Discrete Mathematics, I am excited about the opportunity to share my knowledge and passion for mathematics with Dallas College students.

My academic background has given me a deep appreciation for the importance of mathematics as a foundational discipline. Maintaining a 3.99/4.0 GPA while pursuing my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Science has required mastery of various mathematical concepts, from calculus and linear algebra to discrete mathematics and probability theory. This comprehensive understanding allows me to approach mathematical concepts from multiple angles, which is invaluable when teaching students with diverse learning styles.

My current role as a Grader for Discrete Mathematics for Computing (CS 2305) at UT Dallas has provided valuable insight into common student misconceptions and effective assessment methods. This experience has sharpened my ability to provide constructive feedback that helps students understand not just the correct answer, but the underlying mathematical reasoning. Additionally, my ongoing work authoring "Gus the Goose," a picture book designed to teach Discrete Mathematics to children, demonstrates my commitment to making mathematical concepts accessible and engaging for learners at all levels.

My publication "Survey of Discrete Fair Division" showcases my ability to delve deeply into mathematical topics and communicate complex concepts clearly. This skill is essential for effective mathematics instruction, particularly when introducing students to challenging new concepts.

Beyond my technical qualifications, I bring strong communication skills developed through my experience as a researcher and team leader. My work with TCS Research and HCI Research has honed my ability to explain complex ideas in accessible ways, while my leadership of a 15-person team for Project Kaos has developed my skills in organization, preparation, and responsive teaching.

I understand that teaching mathematics effectively requires not just knowledge of the subject matter, but also patience, clarity, and enthusiasm. My experience performing as a pianist at Cedar Creek Lake United Methodist Church has taught me the importance of preparation, presence, and connecting with an audience—skills that translate directly to the classroom environment.

I am committed to creating an inclusive learning environment where students of all backgrounds feel supported in their mathematical journey. I believe that mathematics should be approachable for all students, and I am dedicated to implementing teaching strategies that address various learning needs.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background, skills, and teaching philosophy align with Dallas College's mission. Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,

Iniyan Joseph
