Dear Hiring Team,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Math Curriculum Designer position at IXL Learning. As a Computer Science student at The University of Texas at Dallas with a passion for mathematics education and experience in creating educational content, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to IXL's mission of making learning more effective and enjoyable for students worldwide.

My academic background has provided me with a comprehensive understanding of mathematical concepts that would be essential for curriculum design. Maintaining a 3.99/4.0 GPA while pursuing Computer Science has required mastery of advanced mathematics including calculus, linear algebra, discrete mathematics, and statistics. This deep mathematical foundation, combined with my current role as a Grader for Discrete Mathematics for Computing, has given me valuable insight into how students learn mathematical concepts and where they commonly encounter difficulties.

What sets me apart as a candidate is my unique blend of mathematical expertise and practical experience in educational content creation. My ongoing project "Gus the Goose," a picture book designed to teach Discrete Mathematics to children, demonstrates my ability to take complex mathematical concepts and present them in engaging, age-appropriate ways. This work has taught me the importance of scaffolding learning, using visual representations, and creating narratives that help students connect with mathematical ideas.

My technical background in Computer Science aligns perfectly with IXL's technology-driven approach to education. My experience developing tools like TurboMarkdown and working with the UTD Nebula Labs API has given me understanding of how educational technology can enhance learning experiences. I appreciate how IXL leverages adaptive learning algorithms and data analytics to personalize education, and I would bring this technical perspective to curriculum design decisions.

My research experience, including my publication "Survey of Discrete Fair Division," has honed my ability to analyze complex topics systematically and present information clearly—skills essential for creating well-structured, coherent curriculum materials. Additionally, my involvement with multiple research projects has taught me to approach problems methodically and consider multiple perspectives, which would be valuable when designing curricula that serve diverse learning needs.

Leadership experience managing a team of 15 people for Project Kaos has developed my project management skills and ability to collaborate effectively with cross-functional teams. I understand that curriculum design at IXL involves coordination with subject matter experts, educational researchers, and technology teams, and I am prepared to contribute effectively in this collaborative environment.

What particularly excites me about IXL is your commitment to using data and research to continuously improve educational outcomes. My analytical background would allow me to contribute not just to curriculum creation, but also to the ongoing analysis and refinement of educational materials based on student performance data.

I am passionate about making mathematics accessible and engaging for all learners, and I believe that well-designed curriculum can transform how students experience and understand mathematical concepts. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my unique combination of mathematical knowledge, educational content creation experience, and technical skills could contribute to IXL's curriculum development efforts.

Thank you for considering my application.

Sincerely,
Iniyan Joseph
