I traveled to Austin and San Antonio with two of my closest friends to visit the respective downtown areas.

== Day 1
I have visited Austin a few times before, and as a city it is very nice. The downtown area is very walkable, and it genuinely feels well designed, while maintaining its own unique character as a city.

== Day 2
