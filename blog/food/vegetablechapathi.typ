My mother often makes chapathi with vegetables mixed into the in the dough. It is rather simple and gives the opportunity to use up leftover vegetables from other cooking. This can be stored in the fridge in an airtight container for a few days.

== Ingredients
- 2$+epsilon$ parts All Purpose Flour
- 1 part diluted vegetable puree
== Directions
- To make the vegetable puree, blend leftover vegetables with some water until it reaches a juice-like consistency.
- Knead with flour until a dough is formed.
- Roll into a circle and cook on griddle until it puffs.
