Tomato soup is a classic of American comfort food. I normally make it two different ways, fresh (roasting the tomatoes in the oven), and on the stove

== Fresh
=== Ingredients
- 1kg tomato
- 1 jalapeno
- 1 onion
- 3 cloves garlic
- 1 cup milk
- 2 cups water
- Basil to taste
- Oregano to taste
- Salt to taste.

=== Directions
- Clean and roast vegetables in the oven at $400^circle$ Fahrenheit until fragrant.
- Blend until smooth and transfer to soup pot.
- Add water and milk and oregano and reduce on stove or until desired consistency. Add water to loosen soup as desired.
