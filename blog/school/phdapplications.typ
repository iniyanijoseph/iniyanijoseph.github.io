Applying to PhD programs is a major decision for many students. In this article I wanted to share my thoughts on the process and make my own admissions documents available.

PhD applications in Computer Science are due in early to mid-December. I recommend starting your application materials in early October to give yourself adequate time for writing, revision, and feedback. Be prepared to write, rewrite, restart, and restart again. You'll also need to arrange for letters of recommendation well in advance. I asked my recommenders once in October, and followed up in November. Ideally, these should be people who you have researched with in the past, especially your PIs/research advisors.

I did not write the GRE - it is becoming increasingly unimportant to applications. That being said, some top schools like MIT and UT Austin required it in the 2025-2026 admissions cycle, so it may be worth writing it if you want to apply to a program which requires it. That being said, there are less apples-to-apples comparisons in graduate school compared to undergrad admissions (especially if you have a strong research background). While in undergrad, SAT optional is not usually a good option if you are able to score well since you have substantial hard-to-differentiate competition, the GRE your application rarely changes substantially.

I recently applied to the following PhD programs (in no particular order): 
- University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (Awaiting decision)
- Purdue (Awaiting decision)
- Duke University (Awaiting decision)
- University of Utah (Awaiting decision)
- UT Dallas (Awaiting decision)
- UC Irvine (Awaiting decision)
- University of Wisconsin - Madison (Awaiting decision)
- University of Waterloo (Awaiting decision)
- New York University (Awaiting decision)
- University of Washington (Awaiting decision)
- Stanford University (Awaiting decision)
- Carnegie Mellon (Awaiting decision)

I selected a #link("sop.pdf")[statement of purpose (SOP)] from one the universities (Purdue) and my #link("personalhistory.pdf")[personal history], and have attached them below.
#footnote[I will replace this SOP with the SOP from the school I decide to attend.]

Compared to writing applications for undergrad, the process of writing PhD applications can be much easier. All schools ask for essentially the same documents, primarily the SOP and Curriculum Vitae (CV). Some schools also ask for a personal history, which complements the SOP by focusing more on your personal journey and how it shaped your research interests.

PhD is far more self-selecting than undergrad - most applicants have research experience already, which is really what PhD programs are looking for first and foremost.

I started writing by outlining the structure of my SOP. I started by explaining what I wanted to do in my PhD and my prior research work. I discussed how my decision to move from human-computer interaction to theoretical CS. I then spoke briefly about my recent work, then my interests at the university I was applying to. I concluded by discussing my broader academic goals in the future.

The SOP serves three purposes: To explain the content of the CV (justifying negative factors like low grades, fast graduation, etc.), to explain your motivations for the work, and how your experiences shaped you and your academic career. This means that all the minutiae of prior work are not relevant, but instead it should be clear what role you had and that you truly contributed meaningfully to the research. This makes the SOP unique to you. Only you can write a meaningful SOP for yourself, because it discusses your research and motivations over time.

That being said, clarity, flow, and the confidence conveyed make up a large part of the application, especially since it may be read only briefly. It should read confidently but humbly, and have a natural progression of thought. My temptation when writing about myself and my accomplishments is to either dismiss my work or to wax poetic on the virtuosity of my achievements. But this kind of writing usually has the opposite effect, since it casts doubt on how honestly you are writing. As my piano teacher says when performing, "Trust the work". Believe in yourself: you have made it this far. This is the same.

The personal history is an even trickier document to write. It reads more narratively, and should speak to your personal life and how it shaped you as a student and researcher. It should also speak to your ability to engage with your research community. After all, research is a group activity and you should show that you will be a good co-worker as a PhD student.

I found the advice of my friends and research community to be very useful. I highly recommend having as many people as possible read your application documents, even if it can feel a bit vulnerable.
