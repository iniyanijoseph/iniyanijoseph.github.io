The decision to graduate in two years was practical: with my sister entering college, I felt a sense of responsibility to graduate early and ease my family's financial burden. Motivated to pursue my academic goals and make the most of my college experience, I conducted research as a freshman, started an algorithms club, and sought out mentors. This pressure taught me to identify opportunities and manage long-term time constraints. To graduate quickly while still pursuing my academic goals, I sought out community and mentorship through a research advisor and various clubs. It shaped me as a student and learner, and gave me the resourcefulness and commitment to maximize my time in graduate school. Going into undergrad, I wanted to develop a specific passion in computer science, and so I joined computer science clubs and research. It is now the desire to become an expert in my field that drives me to pursue a PhD.
