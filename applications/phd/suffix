During my undergraduate studies, I conducted research in both HCI and theoretical computer science, collaborated with faculty and peers, and began defining my research interests. This work solidified my commitment to pursuing higher education and reinforced my desire to conduct research in a collaborative academic environment. Through graduate school and an academic career, I hope to be exposed to and challenged by new ideas from diverse perspectives, and to mentor the next generation of students.
