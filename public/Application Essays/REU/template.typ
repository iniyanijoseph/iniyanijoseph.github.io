= Statement of Purpose

+ Life is unfair. But it does not have to be.
+ Developing theory in a way which has concrete applications
  + Studying EC especially is well suited for my interests (i.e. it has problems which are interesting to me, and are important for society)
  + I want to continue to work on the fair division, which is why I want to pursue a PhD

+ I began my experience in research in HCI under Professor Jin-Ryong Kim in efficient text entry systems in AR/VR.
  + Text entry in AR/VR is difficult to design due to perceptual and feedback issues, and remains an open field of research.
  + In the MI-Lab I co-authored two papers, which are currently under double-blind peer review.
  + The expected contribution of the first paper adresses guidelines to improve depth-perception in the near-field
    + I learned to run studies and analyze results (i.e. i got a feeling for research methodology)
    + I designed studies
  + The second paper focuses more on text entry and establishes the feasibility of
    + I continued working on this and this time additionally explored the literature and wrote related work
    + I proposed new directions for the research

  + Writing these papers taught me about the methodology of research, and helped me decide to continue research in the future and eventually earn my Ph.D. I enjoyed relevance of my work for industry and developing new technology
  + However, I was unsatisfied with text entry and wanted to work more closely with theory while still being connected to my work's applications

+ This lead me to studying fair division with Professor Emily Fox.
  + Two things:
    + I learned to read/write about theory, which was really fun for me
    + I
+ I am currently working on research in computational geometry.
