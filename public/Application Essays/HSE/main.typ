Dear Hiring Manager:

I am writing to express my sincere interest in this position. As a senior pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science at the University of Texas at Dallas, I am eager to apply further my academic knowledge in a research capacity. Along with my studies, my experience researching at the Multimodal Interactions Lab and working on two papers has allowed me to explore human computer interfaces in virtual reality. I worked on designing efficient text entry in virtual reality and augmented reality without handheld controllers, which is increasingly important as we become reliant on such technologies in the future - a yet open question in HCI. For these papers, my role was designing and running experiments and writing related works. We currently have two research papers under submission in a top-tier conference and journal. This exposure has helped me develop skills in analysis, problem-solving, and technical writing. 

My involvement with student organizations like the Fair Division Club, where I serve as President, has provided me with opportunities to collaborate with peers, lead them through learning various subjects, and explore interdisciplinary topics. These experiences have helped me develop strong communication, leadership, and teamwork skills. While I am still a student with much to learn, I am enthusiastic about the prospect of applying my skills and knowledge in a professional setting. 

Currently, I am working with Professor Emily Fox at my university in an independent study setting and am writing a survey paper on fair division. I intend to continue to study economics and computation for a PhD after my undergraduate studies. 

This internship would be an invaluable opportunity for me to gain practical experience as a researcher and further develop my abilities as a computer scientist. Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss my qualifications and potential contributions in more detail. 

Sincerely,
Iniyan Joseph
