[Occupational therapists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Occupational_therapy) in school-based practice often uses several assessments to measure student's various sensory tendencies, skills, and preferences. These assessments are quite tedious to compute by hand. This project provides a UI to take these assessments, and evaluates these results, finally providing a CSV of the assessment results.
