NixOS is a tool for declarative software package management. It provides several benefits, like easy management of packages, dependency management, reproducability, etc.

I recently switched from Debian (those dotfiles can also be found on my website) to NixOS.

My files are heavily inspired by [Frost-Phoenix's](https://github.com/Frost-Phoenix/nixos-config/tree/main).

The system is configured via Hyprland, Waybar, Swaync, etc. My previous configuration used BSPWM (X Server).

Wayland seems promising, and the configuration via Hyprland and NixOS was quite easy, since I was able to see exactly how things were configured.
