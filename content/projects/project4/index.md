I have been using Linux for the past several years. When I switched to a new computer, I decided to use Debian, and to gain some exposure to [ricing](https://jie-fang.github.io/blog/basics-of-ricing). While setting everything up, I created a setup script for my dotfiles (mostly combining and riffing some other themes I found online). My dotfiles are publicly available here. This project taught me alot about how linux actually worked, how users were managed, how and where applications stored/read data, and how my window manager operated. Next step...NixOS config?
