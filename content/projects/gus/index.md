> He declared that the future lies in the hand of the schoolmaster...He desired that society should labor without relaxation at the elevation of the moral and intellectual level, at coining science, at putting ideas into circulation, at increasing the mind in youthful persons. - Les Miserables

In my early education, I went to schools which taught me the 'fundamentals' of mathematics. This helped me develop some mathematical intuition, but when I came to college, I found an entirely new and interesting field which used little, if any, of my prior knowledge of math. In some way, it felt more relatable (having clear visualizations for many things), and its notation and concepts lent itself to a wealth of more difficult works, and re-introduced me to the concepts I already knew (and ultimately lead me to TCS). Because of this, I wanted to share discrete math with others, especially young people who had little prior exposure to math, in a simple way.
