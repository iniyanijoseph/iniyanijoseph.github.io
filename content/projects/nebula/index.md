Nebula Labs is a student team of open-source developers at the University of Texas at Dallas. Nebula focuses on projects relevant to students at the university, and aggregate, analyze, and disseminate data about Professors, Classes, Degree Plans, and Events on campus. To acquire some of their data, they scrape data about the various activites on campus. I contributed a set of scrapers (written in Go using ChromeDP) for scraping various UTD websites as part of the project.
