## Abstract

Fair division is a problem with roots in the Bible and in Greek mythology. When Abraham and Lot must divide the land of Canaan fairly among themselves, one divides the land into two parts (which they perceive to be equally valuable), and the other chooses their favorite piece. This problem has proven to be useful in practice. It has been used for international dispute resolution (Brams 2019), distribution of food for food banks, and estate divisions (Aleksandrov et al. 2015; Mertzanidis, Psomas, and Verma 2024; Caragiannis et al. 2019). This was formalized by (Steinhaus 1948) for both divisible continuous and indivisible discrete goods. Since then, several promising results have been published in both settings, with the existence of a bounded-time envy-free cake cutting procedure being resolved by (Aziz and Mackenzie 2017). However, the fair allocation of a finite set of indivisible goods to individuals “fairly” remains a fundamental open question within computer science and economics. Indeed, many interpretations of fairness exist. In this paper, we survey some common notions of fairness, their computability, and open questions within the field of Fair Division. We also present a small result connecting two notions of fairness (MNW and EQX).
