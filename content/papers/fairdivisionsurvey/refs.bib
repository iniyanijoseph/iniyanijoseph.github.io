abstract = {The maximum Nash welfare (MNW) solution—which selects an allocation that maximizes the product of utilities—is known to provide outstanding fairness guarantees when allocating divisible goods. And while it seems to lose its luster when applied to indivisible goods, we show that, in fact, the MNW solution is strikingly fair even in that setting. In particular, we prove that it selects allocations that are envy-free up to one good—a compelling notion that is quite elusive when coupled with economic efficiency. We also establish that the MNW solution provides a good approximation to another popular (yet possibly infeasible) fairness property, the maximin share guarantee, in theory and—even more so—in practice. While finding the MNW solution is computationally hard, we develop a nontrivial implementation and demonstrate that it scales well on real data. These results establish MNW as a compelling solution for allocating indivisible goods and underlie its deployment on a popular fair-division website.},

We establish that an MNW allocation is always EFX as long as there are at most two possible values for the goods, whereas this implication is no longer true for three or more distinct values.

While the efficient computation of an MNW allocation for two possible values remains an open problem, we present a novel algorithm for directly constructing EFX allocations in this setting.

The main technical result is an existence theorem for approximate CEEI. The mechanism is approximately efficient, satisfies two new criteria of outcome fairness, and is strategyproof in large markets. Its performance is explored on real data, and it is compared to alternatives from theory and practice: all other known mechanisms are either unfair ex post or manipulable even in large markets, and most are both manipulable and unfair. }

	abstract = {Several relaxations of envy-freeness, tailored to fair division in settings with indivisible goods, have been introduced within the last decade. Due to the lack of general existence results for most of these concepts, great attention has been paid to establishing approximation guarantees. In this work, we propose a simple algorithm that is universally fair in the sense that it returns allocations that have good approximation guarantees with respect to four such fairness notions at once. In particular, this is the first algorithm achieving a (ϕ−1)-approximation of envy-freeness up to any good (Image 1) and a 2ϕ+2-approximation of groupwise maximin share fairness (Image 2), where ϕ is the golden ratio (ϕ≈1.618). The best known approximation factor, in polynomial time, for either one of these fairness notions prior to this work was 1/2. Moreover, the returned allocation achieves envy-freeness up to one good (Image 3) and a 2/3-approximation of pairwise maximin share fairness (Image 4). While Image 1 is our primary focus, we also exhibit how to fine-tune our algorithm and further improve the guarantees for Image 2 or Image 4. Finally, we show that Image 2—and thus Image 4 and Image 1—allocations always exist when the number of goods does not exceed the number of agents by more than two.}

	abstract = {This chapter describes a mechanism, applicable to two-party disputes, for dividing divisible items fairly. The mechanism, called adjusted winner, provides a way to determine which contested items, which may be either goods or issues, each party wins entirely, and which single good or issue must be divided, to satisfy three properties of fair division: envy-freeness, efficiency, and equitability. The mechanism has been applied to disputes ranging from interpersonal to international. This chapter applies it to the dispute between Israel and Egypt that was settled, under the auspices of US President Jimmy Carter, at Camp David in 1978.},

abstract = {The problem of allocating divisible goods has enjoyed a lot of attention in both mathematics (e.g. the cake-cutting problem) and economics (e.g. market equilibria). On the other hand, the natural requirement of indivisible goods has been somewhat neglected, perhaps because of its more complicated nature. In this work we study a fairness criterion, called the Max-Min Fairness problem, for k players who want to allocate among themselves m indivisible goods. Each player has a specified valuation function on the subsets of the goods and the goal is to split the goods between the players so as to maximize the minimum valuation. Viewing the problem from a game theoretic perspective, we show that for two players and additive valuations the expected minimum of the (randomized) cut-and-choose mechanism is a 1/2-approximation of the optimum. To complement this result we show that no truthful mechanism can compute the exact optimum.We also consider the algorithmic perspective when the (true) additive valuation functions are part of the input. We present a simple 1/(m - k + 1) approximation algorithm which allocates to every player at least 1/k fraction of the value of all but the k - 1 heaviest items. We also give an algorithm with additive error against the fractional optimum bounded by the value of the largest item. The two approximation algorithms are incomparable in the sense that there exist instances when one outperforms the other.},

abstract = {Many industrial or research activities are so expensive that it is often benefitable for the involved agents to cofund the construction or the purchase of a common required resource. This resource will then be exploited in common, therefore in a shared way. The rules for resource sharing should take account of the possibly antagonistic preferences: each agent wants to maximize its own satisfaction, whereas, from the collective point of view, decisions which both are equitable and exploit the resource in an optimal way are looked for. We give in this article a formal model for indivisible goods resource sharing without monetary compensations and with arbitrary feasability constraints. We also give some complexity results about this model. The model is applied to a real-world case, namely satellite resource sharing.},
